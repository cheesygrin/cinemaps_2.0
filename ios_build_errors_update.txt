Updated iOS Build Errors for Cinemaps Flutter App (Feb 21, 2024)

Current Errors:
1. 'Flutter/Flutter.h' file not found in multiple files:
   - share_plus plugin
   - geocoding_ios plugin
   - sqflite_darwin plugin
2. Swift Compiler Error: No such module 'Flutter' in:
   - shared_preferences_foundation
   - path_provider_foundation

Environment:
- iOS Target: 14.0
- Device: iPhone (Zero Delta)
- Xcode Version: 16.2
- macOS: 15.3.1
- Flutter Dependencies: Multiple Firebase packages and iOS-specific plugins

Recent Attempted Solutions:
1. Updated Podfile with BoringSSL-GRPC specific configurations
2. Cleaned and reinstalled pods
3. Ran flutter precache --ios
4. Deintegrated and reintegrated pods
5. Updated CocoaPods repositories

Current State:
- Previous error with '-G' flag seems resolved
- New errors indicate Flutter framework is not being properly linked
- Multiple plugins unable to find Flutter framework headers
- Issue appears to be with Flutter framework integration rather than Firebase/BoringSSL

Next Steps Needed:
1. Verify Flutter framework is properly generated and linked
2. Check Xcode project settings for framework search paths
3. Verify Flutter.framework exists in expected location
4. May need assistance with proper Flutter framework integration in Xcode

Note: We seem to have moved from a compiler flag issue to a framework linking issue, suggesting our previous fixes may have altered the project structure in an unexpected way.
