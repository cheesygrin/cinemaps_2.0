============================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
----------------
- Project Name: Cinemaps
- Project Type: Flutter mobile application
- Current Status: In migration from Firebase to Supabase
- Target Platform: iOS (specifically iPhone/Zero Delta device)
- Development Environment: macOS

MIGRATION CONTEXT:
-----------------
1. Original Stack:
   - Backend: Firebase (being removed)
   - Authentication: Firebase Auth
   - Storage: Firebase Storage
   - Database: Firebase Firestore

2. New Stack:
   - Backend: Supabase
   - Authentication: Supabase Auth
   - Storage: Supabase Storage
   - Database: Supabase PostgreSQL
   - Supabase Project URL and anon key are configured

CURRENT STATUS:
--------------
1. Completed Changes:
   - Removed Firebase test files (auth_test.dart, firebase_test.dart)
   - Updated storage_service.dart to use Supabase
   - Cleaned up gallery_service.dart from Firebase references
   - Removed Firebase configuration files
   - Updated main.dart to initialize Supabase instead of Firebase

2. Current Issues:
   - Build fails with error: "Couldn't resolve the package 'firebase_core'"
   - iOS build system still looking for Firebase dependencies
   - Bundle identifier issues in iOS configuration
   - CocoaPods integration warnings

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
-----------------
1. Current Dependencies (pubspec.yaml):
   - supabase_flutter: ^2.3.4
   - flutter_dotenv: ^5.2.1
   - Other standard Flutter packages

2. iOS Configuration:
   - Deployment Target: iOS 14.0
   - Current Bundle ID causing issues
   - Custom XCConfig settings present

3. Build Environment:
   - macOS Version: darwin 24.3.0
   - Flutter Version: Latest stable
   - Xcode Integration: Enabled
   - CocoaPods being used for iOS dependencies

ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS:
------------------
1. Clean Build Attempts:
   - flutter clean
   - Removing Pods directory
   - Deintegrating CocoaPods
   - Cleaning build cache
   - Regenerating iOS files

2. Configuration Updates:
   - Attempted to update bundle identifier
   - Tried rebuilding without codesign
   - Attempted to clean iOS build files
   - Tried regenerating Flutter iOS files

REMAINING TASKS:
---------------
1. Remove any remaining Firebase references from:
   - Build configurations
   - iOS project settings
   - Cached build files
   - Any remaining Dart files

2. Fix iOS Build Issues:
   - Resolve bundle identifier
   - Fix CocoaPods integration
   - Remove Firebase build phases
   - Update signing configuration

SUPABASE CONFIGURATION:
---------------------
URL: https://qykabnvjwzhldlqcybwn.supabase.co
Anon Key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InF5a2FibnZqd3pobGRscWN5YnduIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDAyNjA2MDYsImV4cCI6MjA1NTgzNjYwNn0.8wRftXMpB_01rx5Xahf7t5gdWCVk6Rd0Z0rR90nvchU

NEXT STEPS NEEDED:
----------------
1. Complete removal of Firebase:
   - Verify no remaining Firebase imports in Dart files
   - Remove Firebase references from iOS configuration
   - Clean up any remaining Firebase build artifacts

2. iOS Build System:
   - Fix bundle identifier issues
   - Resolve CocoaPods integration warnings
   - Update signing configuration
   - Remove Firebase build phases

3. Verification:
   - Ensure all Firebase dependencies are removed
   - Verify Supabase services are properly initialized
   - Test all features that previously used Firebase

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
---------------
- The app's core functionality has been updated to use Supabase
- Main.dart is properly configured for Supabase
- Storage service has been migrated to use Supabase
- The issue appears to be primarily with iOS build configuration
- Firebase references might still exist in cached build files
