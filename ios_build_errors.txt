iOS Build Errors for Cinemaps Flutter App

Main Error:
- Error (Xcode): unsupported option '-G' for target 'arm64-apple-ios14.0'

Context:
- This error occurs during the compilation of BoringSSL-GRPC (a dependency of Firebase)
- The error persists even after:
  1. Setting IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 14.0
  2. Removing problematic compiler flags
  3. Setting valid architectures to arm64 and arm64e
  4. Disabling bitcode
  5. Attempting to modify OTHER_CFLAGS and OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS

Additional Warnings:
- CocoaPods warning about base configuration not being set
- Warning about Run script build phase 'Create Symlinks to Header Folders'

Environment:
- iOS Target: 14.0
- Device: iPhone 14 Pro Max (Zero Delta)
- iOS Version: 18.3
- Flutter Dependencies:
  * firebase_core: ^2.24.2
  * firebase_auth: ^4.15.3
  * cloud_firestore: ^4.13.6
  * firebase_storage: ^11.5.6

Attempted Solutions:
1. Cleaned project and pods
2. Updated Podfile with special handling for BoringSSL-GRPC
3. Modified compiler flags and architecture settings
4. Set OPENSSL_NO_ASM=1 for BoringSSL-GRPC
5. Removed problematic compiler flags

The error seems to be specifically related to the BoringSSL-GRPC pod trying to use the '-G' compiler flag, which is not supported for the arm64-apple-ios14.0 target.

To determine the error preventing your project from running, you need to check the contents of the `ios_build_errors.txt` and `ios_build_errors_update.txt` files. These files likely contain the error messages or logs that can help identify the issue.

Here is how you can check the error logs:

1. Open the `ios_build_errors.txt` file.
2. Open the `ios_build_errors_update.txt` file.

You can open these files using any text editor or directly from the terminal using commands like `cat` or `less`.
