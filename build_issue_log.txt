Flutter iOS Build Issue Log
Date: February 2024
Device: iPhone (Zero Delta) - iOS 18.3
Flutter Version: 3.29.0 (stable channel)

ERROR DESCRIPTION:
==================
Primary Error: "unsupported option '-G' for target 'arm64-apple-ios14.0'"
Environment:
- macOS 15.3.1 24D70 darwin-arm64
- Xcode 16.2 (Build 16C5032a)
- CocoaPods version 1.16.2

CURRENT CONFIGURATION:
=====================
1. iOS Deployment Target: 14.0
2. Architecture Settings:
   - Architectures: Standard (arm64)
   - Valid Architectures: arm64
   - Excluded Architectures (simulator): i386

PODFILE CONFIGURATION:
=====================
- Platform iOS: 14.0
- Firebase Core: 10.25.0
- Bitcode: Disabled
- Frameworks: use_frameworks! enabled
- Post-install configuration includes:
  - IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = '14.0'
  - EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*] = 'i386'
  - ENABLE_BITCODE = 'NO'
  - VALID_ARCHS = 'arm64'

ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS:
===================
1. Clean Build Attempts:
   - flutter clean
   - pod deintegrate
   - pod install
   - Xcode clean build folder
   Result: Error persists

2. Configuration Updates:
   - Updated Podfile with explicit architecture settings
   - Modified BoringSSL-GRPC target settings
   - Disabled inheritance of C flags
   Result: Error persists

3. Build Mode Variations:
   - Debug mode: Failed
   - Release mode: Failed
   - No fast start: Failed

4. Special Handling for BoringSSL-GRPC:
   - Removed -G flag from OTHER_CFLAGS
   - Removed -G flag from OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS
   - Set INHERIT_CFLAGS to NO
   Result: Error persists

PACKAGE VERSIONS:
================
Dependencies with available updates:
- firebase_core: 2.32.0 (3.12.0 available)
- cloud_firestore: 4.17.5 (5.6.4 available)
- firebase_auth: 4.20.0 (5.5.0 available)
- firebase_storage: 11.7.7 (12.4.3 available)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INVESTIGATION:
================================
1. Compiler Investigation:
   - Check if the -G flag is being introduced by other dependencies
   - Investigate if the issue is specific to iOS 18.3
   - Review Flutter's compatibility with latest iOS version

2. Build Configuration:
   - Consider updating Firebase packages to latest versions
   - Review CocoaPods configuration for potential conflicts
   - Check for any conflicting architecture settings

3. Alternative Approaches to Consider:
   - Test on iOS simulator
   - Create new project and migrate code
   - Downgrade Flutter version
   - Use different iOS deployment target

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Review Xcode build logs for additional context
2. Check if issue is present in Flutter issues tracker
3. Consider testing with iOS 17.x device if available
4. Investigate if updating all Firebase dependencies resolves the issue

Note: This issue appears to be related to the interaction between Flutter's build system, 
iOS 18.3, and the way certain compiler flags are handled, particularly the -G flag 
which is causing conflicts with the arm64 architecture build process.
